# 📚 Library Management System Project (C++ Console, OOP)

Welcome to the **Library Management System** project!  

This educational project is designed to help you master `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++` by building a fully functional library management application with a console-based ASCII interface.

## 🌟 Project Overview

| Category         | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | Learn and apply OOP concepts in C++ by managing a library system through a user-friendly console interface.  |
| **Tech Stack**   | C++ (OOP), ASCII-based console UI                                                                           |
| **Main Objects** | ThuVien (Library), Sach (Book), DocGia (Reader), PhieuMuon (Borrow Slip)                                    |
| **Audience**     | Students, educators, and anyone interested in C++ OOP and console application development                   |

## 🗂️ Main Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Classes for Library, Book, Reader, and Borrow Slip, demonstrating encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Book Management:** Add, edit, delete, search, and list books in the library.

- **Reader Management:** Register, update, delete, and list library readers.

- **Borrow/Return Management:** Issue and return books, manage borrow slips, and track overdue items.

- **ASCII Console UI:** Interactive, menu-driven interface using ASCII art and console manipulation for a better user experience.

- **Data Persistence:** Save and load library data from files for continuity between sessions.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **C++:** Core language for OOP and logic implementation.
- **Standard Library:** For file I/O, data structures, and string manipulation.
- **ASCII Console:** For drawing menus, tables, and prompts.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Start the Application:** Launch the console executable to access the main menu.

2. **Manage Books:** Add new books, search by title/author, update or remove entries.

3. **Manage Readers:** Register new readers, update information, or remove from the system.

4. **Borrow & Return:** Issue borrow slips, process returns, and view borrowing history.

5. **View Reports:** List all books, readers, and current borrowings with clear ASCII tables.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Master OOP principles: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
- Design and implement a modular, maintainable C++ application.
- Practice file I/O and data persistence in C++.
- Create interactive, user-friendly console applications using ASCII art.

---

## 💡 Getting Started

- Clone the repository and open the project in your favorite C++ IDE.
- Build the project using CMake or your preferred build system.
- Run the executable and explore the library management features via the console UI.
